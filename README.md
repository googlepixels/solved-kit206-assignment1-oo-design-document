Your small development team of (ideally) three people has been asked to develop the software design for the Researcher Assessment Program desktop application based on its requirements document and trace matrix (RTM). Your design will incorporate structured text‐based scenarios, accompanying low‐fi UI prototypes, a package diagram, class diagrams and sequence diagrams.

<h2>Team formation</h2>

Your teammates should be selected from other students in your tutorial group. To register who is in your team, go to the Groups page on the unit’s MyLO site and select a group from the Assignment 1 list. Groups are named according to the tutorial group they are for. For example, if you are in the Tuesday 9am tutorial then pick one of the teams named <em>k206_a1_tue0900_#</em>, where # is one of the team numbers. Join a team of your choosing (but discuss it with any other members first). You can see who else is currently in a team before you add yourself to it by clicking the <em>#</em>/3 link on the Groups page. If it becomes necessary to form groups larger than three then you will need to contact the unit coordinator.

Your team will have access to its own discussion forum and MyLO locker (for sharing files). You do not have to use these. If you prefer another file sharing mechanism, such as Dropbox or a Google Doc for the scenarios, then you may use it instead. Your team will also have a single submission point in the Assignment 1 folder on MyLO.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

There are five components of the deliverables in this assignment (items 2–6), which should be submitted in a single PDF in the following order.

<ol>

 <li>A title page showing the name and number of the assignment and your group name</li>

 <li>A structured scenario for each use case (7 in total)</li>

 <li>Low‐fidelity (lo‐fi) prototypes of the UI views (hand‐drawn or simply‐sketched on a computer)</li>

 <li>A package diagram</li>

 <li>A class diagram for each package (about 3–5 in total, depending on the number of packages)</li>

 <li>A sequence diagram for each scenario (7 sequence diagrams in total)</li>

</ol>

There are many tools for merging PDFs into a single document, such as <u>this one</u> (provided as an example with no warranty expressed or implied). If it is not possible to submit a single PDF then each component of the submission must still be in PDF; do not submit image files of your lo‐fi prototypes.

<h3>Notes and     comments</h3>

At this stage the client has not provided you with details of the database and its schema (structure of the tables), so develop your class diagrams based on the data described in the requirements document and RTM, and by considering what relationships and operations (methods) best suit the use cases you need to implement.

Further, to promote a modular design, it is required that your packages include the following: a <strong>Database package</strong>, the classes of which will be responsible for interfacing with the database and possibly transforming the data into a form that can be used to create other application objects; and a <strong>View package</strong>, into which the various GUI components (i.e., classes) will go. At this stage you do not need to add as much detail to the classes in these two packages as the others you will define. Many of their details will depend on specifics of the database, which you do not know, and knowledge of the capabilities of the Windows Presentation Foundation classes you will ultimately use to construct the GUI, which you are yet to learn.

A mock interview with the client will be provided shortly to answer common questions. It will be expanded as common questions arise.

<h2>Assessment</h2>

The assessment criteria are available in an accompanying document, in Excel and PDF formats.

<h3>Peer   assessment</h3>

Peer assessment will be completed as part of the tutorial in week 7. You will have the opportunity to provide both qualitative and quantitative feedback on your teammates’ performance.
